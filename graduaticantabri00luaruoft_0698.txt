THE HOLY SCRIPTURES, &a

THE CAMBRIDGE PARAGRAPH BIBLE of the Au-

thorized English Version‚ with the Text Revised by a Collation of its
Early and other Principal Editions, the Use of the Italic Type made
uniform, the Marginal References remodelled, and a Critical Intro-
duction prefixed, by F. H. A. SCRIVENER, Μ.Α., LL.D.‚ Editor of
the Greek Testament, Codex Augiensis, &c.‚ and one of the Revisers

of the Authorized Version.

From the Times.

“Students of the Bible should be particu-
larly grateful to (the Cambridge University
Press) for having produced, with the able as-
sistance of Dr Scrivener, a complete critical
edition of the Authorized Version of the Eng-
lish Bible, an edition such as, to use the words
of the Editor, ‘would have been executed long
ago had this version been nothing more than
the greatest and best known of English elas-
sics.' Falling at a time when the formal revi-
sion of this version has been undertaken by a
distinguished company of scholars and divines,
the publication of this edition must be con-
sidered most opportune.” ,

From the A tkenoeum.

“Apart from its religious importance, the
English Bible has the glory, which but few
sister versions indeed can claim, of being the
chief classic of the language, of having, in
conjunction with Shakspeare‚ and in an im-
measurable degree more than he, fixed the
language beyond any possibility of important
change. Thus the recent contributions to the
literature of the subject, by such workers as
Mr Francis F ry and Canon Westcott, appeal
to a wide range of sympathies; and to these
may now be added Dr Scrivener, well known
for his labours in the cause of the Greek Testa-
ment criticism, who has brought out, for the

Syndics of the Cambridge University Press,
an edition of the English Bible‚ according to
the text of 1611, revised by a comparison with

later issues on principles stated by him in his - ‚

Introduction. Here he enters at length into
the history of the chief editions of the version,

and of such features as the marginal notes, the ·

use of italic type, and the changes of ortho—
graphy‚ as well as into the most interestin
question as to the original texts from whic
our translation is produced. ”

From the Methodist Recorder.

“ This noble quarto of over 1300 pages isin
every respect worthy of editor and publishers
alike. The name of the Cambridge University
Press is guarantee enough forits perfection in
outward form, the name of the editor is equal
guarantee for the worth and accuracy of its
contents. without question, it is the best
Paragraph Bible ever published, and its re-
duced price of a guinea brings it within reach
of a large number of students.’'

From the London Quarterly Review.

“ The work is worthy in every respect of the
editor's fame, and of the Cambridge University
Press. The noble English Version, to which
our country and religion owe so much, was

probably never presented before in so perfect aq
orm. ⁸
