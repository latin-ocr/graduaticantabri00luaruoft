THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST MARK. By the Rev.
G. F. MACLEAR‚ D.D. With 3Maps. 4s.6d.

“The Cambridge Greek Testament, of which Dr Maclear’s edition of the Gospel according to
St Mark is a volume, certainly supplies a want. without pretending to compete with the leading
commentaries, or to embody very much original research, it forms a most satisfactory introduction
to the study of the New Testament in the original . . . Dr Maclear’s introduction contains all that
is known of St Mark's life, with references to passages in the New Testament in which he is
mentioned; an account of the circumstances in which the Gospel was composed, with an estimate
of the influence of St Peter’s teaching upon St Mark: an excellent sketch of the special character-
istics of this Gospel; an analysis. and a chapter on the text of the New Testament generally . . .
The work is completed by three good maps.’'—Saturday Revz‘ew.

“The Notes, which are admirably put together, seem to coutain all that is necessary for the
guidance of the student, as well as a judicious selectiou of passages from various sources illustrat-
ing scenery and manners.”—Academy.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST JOHN. By the Rev. A.
PLUMMER‚ M.A., D.D. With 4 Maps. 6s.

“ A valuable addition has also been made to ‘The Cambridge Greek Testament for Schools,’

and embody the results of rnuch thought and wide reading. ''-Expositar.
