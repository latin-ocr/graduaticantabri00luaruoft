SIR THOMAS MORE'S UTOPIA. With Notes by the

Rev. J. RAWSON LUMBY, D.D., Norrisian Professor of Divinity3 late F ellow
of St Catharine's College, Cambridge. 35. 6d. ’

“To Dr Lumby we must give praise unqualified and unstinted. He has done his work
admirably ..... Every student of history, every politician, every social reformer, every one
interested in literary curiosities, every lover of English should buy and carefully read Dr
Lumby’s edition of the ‘Utopia.' We are afraid to say more lest we should be thought ex·
travagant, and our recommendation accordingly lose part of its force.’'-The Teacher.

“ lt was originally written in Latin and does not find a place on ordinary bookshelves. A very
great boon has therefore been conferred on the general English reader by the managers of the
Pz'tt Press Series, in the issue ofa convenient little volume os AWore's Utopia not in the original
Latin, but in the quaint English Translation thereos made by Raphe Robynson, which adds a
linguistic interest to the intrinsic merit of the work. . . . All this has been edited in a most com-
plete and scholarly fashion by Dr J R. Lumby, the Norrisian Professor os Divinity, whose name
alone is a sufficient warrant for its accuracy. It is a real addition to the modern stock os Classical
English literature. ''—Gnardian.
