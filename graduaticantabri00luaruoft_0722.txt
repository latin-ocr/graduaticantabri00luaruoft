“Those students are to be deerned fortunate who have to read Cieero’s lively and brilliant>
oration for L. Murena with Mr Heitland’s bandy edition, which may be pronounced ‘four-square'

second edition.’'—Saturday Review. -

a Plan of Rome and Notes by A. SIDGWICK‚ M.A. Tutor of Corpus Christi
College‚ Oxford. 1s. 6a'.

“ Mr Sidgwick's editing of the Sixth Book of Ovid’s Fasti furnishes a careful and serviceabl‘e
volume for average students. It eschews ‘ construes' which supersede the use os the dicdonary,
but gives full explanation of grammatical tsages and historica! and mythical allusions, besides
illustrating peculiarities of style, true and false derivations, and the more remarkable variations 01
the text.’'—-Saturday Review.

“ Itis eminently good and useful. . . . The Introduction is singularly clear on the astronomy of
Ovid, which is properly shown to be ignorant and confused; there is an excellent little map of
Rome, giving just the places mentioned in the text and no more ; the notes are evidently written
by a practical schoolmaster.’'— lee Academy.
