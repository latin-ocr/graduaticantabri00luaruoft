AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF JUS-

TINIAN⁷s DIGEST. Containing an account of its composition
and of the Jurists used or referred to therein, together with a full
Commentary on one Title (de usufructu), by HENRYJOHN ROBY, M.A.,
formerly Classical Lecturer in St John’s Cossege, Cambridge, and
Prof. of Jurisprudence, University College, London. Demy 8vo. 18s.

“Not an obscurity, philological, historical,
or legal, has been left unsifted. More inform-
ing aid still has been supplied to the student of
the Digest at large by a preliminary account,
covering nearly 300 pages, of the mode of
composition of the Digest, and of the jurists
whose decisions and arguments constitute its
substance. Nowhere else can a clearer view
be obtained of the personal succession by which
the tradition of Roman legal science was sus-

tained and developed. Roman law, almost
more than Roman legions, was the backbone
of the Roman commonwealth. Mr Roby. by
his careful sketch of the sages of Roman law,
from Sextus Papirius, under Tarquin the
Proud, to the Byzantine Bar, has contributed to
render the tenacity and durability of the most
enduring polity the world has ever experienced
somewhat more intelligible.‘'—Yhe Times.

THE COMMENTARIES OF GAIUS AND RULES OF

ULPIAN. (New Edition‚ revised. and. enlarged.)

With a Trans-

lation and NoteS, by J. T. ABDY, LL.D., Judge of County Courts‚
late Regius Professor of Laws in the University of Cambridge, and
BRYAN WALKER, M.A., LL.D., Law Lecturer of St John’s College,
Cambridge, formerly Law Student of Trinity Hall and Chancellor's

Medallist for Legal Studies.

“As scholars and as editors Messrs Abdy
and Walker have done their work well . . . For
one thing the editors deserve special commen-
dation. They have presented Gaius to the
reader with few notes and those merely by

way of reference or necessary explanation.
Thus the Roman jurist is allowed to speak for
himself, and the reader feels that he is really
studying Roman law in the original, and not a
fanciful representation os it.'’—A thenaeum.

THE INSTITUTES OF JUSTINIAN, translated with

N otes by

J. T. ABDY, LL.D., Judge of County Courts‚ late Regius

Professor of Laws in the University of Cambridge, and formerly
Fellow of Trinity Hall; and BRYAN WALKER, M.A., LL.D., Law
Lecturer of St John’s College, Cambridge3 late F ellow and Lecturer
of Corpus Christi College; and formerly Law Student of Trinity

Hall. Crown 8vo. 16s.

“We welcome here a valuable contribution
to the study ofjurisprudence. The text of the
Institutes is occasionally perplexing‚ even to
practised scholars, whose knowledge of clas-
sical models does not always avail them in
dealing with the technicalities of legal phrase-
ology. Nor can the ordinary dictionaries be
expected to furnish all the help that is wanted.
This translation will then be of great use. To

the ordinary student, whose attention is dis-
tracted from the subject-matter by the dis-
ficulty of struggling through the language in =
which it is contained, it will be almost indis-
pensable.”-Spectator.

“ The notes are learned and carefully com-

piled, and this edition will be found useful to
students.''—Law Times.
