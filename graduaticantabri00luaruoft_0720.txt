ΤΗΕ ANABASIS OF XENOPHON, BOOKS I. III. IV.

and V. With a Map and English Notes by ALFRED PRETOR, M.A., Fellow
Zirfitssissiiiirmiis. {gelllfigffi Cambridge ; Editor of Persius and Cicero ad Atti-

“In Mr Pretor's edition of the Anabasis the text of Kiihner has been followed in the main,
while the exhaustive and admirable notes of the great German editor have been largely utilised.
These notes deal with the minutest as well as the most important difficulties in construction, and
aEll questions of history, antiquity, and geography are briefly but very effectually elucidated.''— The

xalnlner.

“ We welcome this addition to the other books of the Anabasis so ably edited by Mr Pretor.
Although originally intended for the use of candidates at the university local examinations‚ yet
this edition will be found adapted not only to meet the wants os the junior student, but even
advanced scholars will find much in this work that will repay its perusal.‘'—Tlce Schoolmaster.

“Mr Pretor’s ‘Anabasis of Xenophon, Book IV.' displays a union of accurate Cambridge
scholarship. with experience of what is required by learners gained in examining middle-class
schools. The text is large and clearly printed, and the notes explain all difficulties. . . . Mr
Pretor's notes seem to be all that could be wished as regards grammar, geography, and other
matterS.”— The Academy.

BOOKS II. VI. and VII. By the same Editor. 25. 6d. each.

“Another Greek text, designed it would seem sor students preparing for the local examinationS,
is ‘Xenophon’s Anabasis,' Book 11„ with English Notes, by Alfred pretor, M.A. The editor has ’
exercised his usual discrimination in utilising the text and notes of Kuhner, with the occasional
assistance of the best hints os Schneider, Vollbrecht and Macmichael on critical matters, and of
Mr R. W. Taylor on points of history and g'eography. . . When Mr Pretor commits himself to
Commentator’s work, he is eminently helpful. . . Had we to introduce a young Greek scholar
to Xenophon, we should esteem ourselves fortunate in having Pretor’s text-book as our chart and

guide. ”—Contemporary R eview.
