A SELECTION OF THE STATE TRIALS. By J. W.

3‘ “Mr winis-ssund has edited ‘A selection of
Cases from the State Trials' which is likely to
form a very valuable addition to the standard
literature . . . There can be no doubt, therefore,
of the interest that can be found in the State
trials. But they are large and unwieldy‚ and it
is impossible sor the general reader to come
across them. Mr Willis-Bund has therefore
done good service in making a selection that
is in the first volume reduced to a commodious
form. ’'— lee E xa miner.
“This work is a very useful contribution to
that important branch of the constitutional his-
tory of England which is concerned with the
growth and development of the law of treason‚
as it may be gathered from trials before the
ordinary courts. The author has very wisely
distinguished these cases from those of im-
peachment sor treas-on before Parliament‚ which
he proposes to treat in a future volume under
the general head ‘Proceedings in Parliament.'”

“ This is a work of such obvious utility that
’ the only wonder is that no one should have un-
dertaken it before . . . ln many respects there-

fore, although the trials are more or less v

abridged, this is for the ordinary student's pur-
pose not only a more handy, but a more useful

work than Howell's.”-Saturday Review.

‘⁴ But, although the book is most interesting
to the historian of constitutional law, it is also
not without considerable value to those who
seek information with regard to procedure and
the growth of the law of evidence. We should
add that Mr Willis-Bund has given short pre-
faces and appendices to the trials, so as to form
a connected narrative of the events in history
to which they relate. We can thoroughly re-
commend the book. ”—Law Times.

“ To a large class of readers Μι- Willis-
Bund's compilation will thus be of great as-
sistance, for he presents in a convenient form a
judicious selection of the principal statutes and
the leading cases bearing on the crime of trea-
son . . . For all classes of readers these volumes'
possess an indirect interest, arising from the
nature of the cases themselves, srom the men
who were actors in them, and from the numerous
points of social life which are incidentally illus-
trated in the course of the trials. On these
features we have not dwelt‚ but have preferred
to show that the book is a valuable contribution
to the study of the subject with which it pro-
fesses to deal, namely, the history of the law of
treason. ' ' —A tkenaeu m.

‘⁸ In the present book we have the fruits of
the same kind of thorough and well-ordered
study which was brought to bear upon the notes
to the Commentaries and the lnstitutes . . .
Hitherto the Edict has been almost inac-
oessible to the ordinary English student, and
