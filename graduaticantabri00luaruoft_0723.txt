IV., V., VI., VII.‚ VIII.‚ ΙΧ., Χ., ΧΙ., XII. Edited with Notes by A.
SIDGWICK, M.A. Tutor of Corpus Christi CoHege, Oxford. Is. 6d. each.

“ Much more attention is given to the literary aspect of the poem than is usually paid to it in
editions intended for the use of beginners. The introduction points out the distinction between
prismitiveland literary epics, explains the purpose of the poem, and gives an outline of the story.''
— atur a Review.

“ Mr Afthur Sidgwick's ‘Vergil, Aeneid, Book X11.’ is worthy of his reputation‚ and is dis-
tinguished by the same acuteness and accuracy of knowledge, appreciation of a boy's difficulties
and ingenuity and resource in meeting them, which we have on other occasions had reason to
praise in these pages.''— The Acade-my.

“As masterly in its clearly divided presace and appendices as in the sound and independent
character ofits annotations. . . . There is a great deal more in the notes than mere compilation
and suggestion. No difficulty is left unnoticed or unhandled.”—Saturday Review.

“This edition is admirably adapted for the use os junior students, who will find in it the result
of much reading in a eondensed form, and clearly expressed.”—Cambridge Independent Press.

QUINTUS CURTIUS. A Portion of the History.

(ALEXANDER IN INDIA.) By W. E. HEITLAND, M.A., Fellow and Lecturer
of St John’s CoHege, Cambridge, and T. E. RAVEN, B.A., Assistant Master
in Sherborne School. 35. 6d.

“Equally commendable as a genuine addition to the ex1sting stock of school-books is
Alexander in India, a compilation from the eighth and ninth books of Q. Curtius, edited sor
the Pitt Press by Messrs Heitland and Raven. . . . The work os Curtius has merits os its
own, which, in former generations, made it a favourite with English scholars, and which still
make it a popular text-book in Continental schools. . . . . . The reputation of Mr Heitland is a

K sufficient guarantee for the scholarship of the notes, which are ample without being excessive,

and the book is well furnished with all that is needtul in the nature of maps, indexes‚ and ap-
pendices.’' -A cademy.

Heitland deserve praise.'’—Saturday R eview.

BEDA’S ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY‚ BOOKS

ΙΙΙ., IV„ the Text from the very ancient MS. in the Cambridge University
Library‚ collated with six other MSS. Edited, with a life from the German of
EBERT, and with Notes, ἃς. by J. E. B. MAYOR‚ M.A., Professor os Latin,
and J. R. LUMBY, D.D., Norrisian Professor of Divinity. Revised edition.
7s. 6d.

“To young students of English History the illustrative notes will be of great service, whlle
the study of the texts will be a good introduction to Mediaeval Latin.''- The Nonconsormist.

“In Bede’s works Englishmen can go back to origines of their history, unequalled for
form and matter by any modern European nation. Prof. Mayor has done good service in ren-
dering a part of Bede's greatest work accessible to those who can read Latin with ease. He
has adorned this edition of the third and fourth books of the ‘Ecclesiastical History' with that
amazing eruditiori for which he is unrivalled among Englishmen and rarely equalled by Germans.
And however interesting and valuable the text may be, we can certainly apply to his notes
the expression, La sauce vaut mieux que le pois-son. They are literally crammed with interest-
ing information about early English lise. For though ecclesiastical in name, Bede’s history treats
os all parts of the national lise, since the Church had points of contact with all.'’—Examiner.
