Μ. Τ. CICERONIS DE AMICITIA. Edited by J. S.

REID, M.L., Fellow and Assistant Tutor.0f Gonville and Caius CoHege,
Cambridge. New Edition, with Additions. 35. 6d.

“Mr Reid has decidedly attained his aim, namely, ‘a thorough examination of the Latinity
of the dialogue.’ ..... The revision of the text is most valuable, and comprehends sundry
agute corrections. '‚; . This volume, like Mr Reid's other editions, is a solid gain to the scholar-
s ιε’ἳξ tiiii)iflimditsltilict ²{iiitril‘’tygaegh'iiolarship is Mr Reid’s able and thorough edition of the De
Amicitia of Cicero, a work of which, whether we regard the exhaustive introduction or the
instructive and most suggestive commentary, it would be difficult to speak too highly. . . . XVhen
we come to the commentary, we are only amazed by its fulness in proportion to its bulk.
Nothing is overlooked which can tend to enlarge the learner’s general knowledge of Ciceronian
Latin or to elucidate the text.’'—- Satur-day Review.

M. T. CICERONIS CATO MAJOR DE SENECTUTE.
Edited by J. S. ΚΕΗ), M.L. 3s. 62¹.

“The notes are excellent and scholarlike, adapted for the upper forms of public schools, and
likely to be useful even to more advanced students.”—Guardian.

M. T. CICERONIS ORATIO PRO ARCHIA POETA.
Edited by J. S. ΚΕΗ), M.L. Revised Edition. 2s.

“ It is an admirable specimen of careful editing. An Introduction tells us everything we could
wish to know about Archias, about Cicero's connexion with him, about the merits of the trial, and
the genuineness of the speech. The text is well and carefully printed. The notes are clear and
scholar-like. . . . No boy can master this little volume without feeling that he has advanced a long

step in scholarship.''— The Academy. >

M. T. CICERONIS PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO ORA-
TIO. Edited by J. S. Rmn, M.L. 15.6d.

“We are bound to recognize the pains devoted in the annotation of these two orations to the
minute and thorough study of their Latinity. both in the ordinary notes and in the textual
appendices.”—Saturday Revc‘ew. ¹

M. T. CICERONIS PRO P. CORNELIO SULLA'
ORATIO. Edited by J. S. REm, M.L. μω.

“ Mr Reid is so well known to scholars as a commentator on Cicero that a new work from him
scarcely needs any commendation of ours. His edition of the speech Pro Sulla is fully equal in
merit to the volumes which he has already published . . . It would be difficult to speak too highly
of the notes. There could be no better way of gaining an insight into the characteristics of
Cicero’s style and the Latinity of his period than by making a careful study of this speech with
the aid of Mr Reid’s commentary . . . Μι- Reid’s intimate knowledge of the minutest details of
scholarship enables him to detect and explain⁴ the slightest points of distinction between the
usages of different authors and different periods . . . The notes are followed by a valuable
appenldix 3¹² §het tezelt² aped another on points of orthography3 an excellent index brings the work
to a c ose. —- a ur ay evzew· -

M. T. CICERONIS PRO CN. PLANCIO ORATIO.

Edigeld by H. A. HOLDEN, LL.D.‚ late Head Master of Ipswich School.
4s. .

“As a book sor students this edition can have few rivals. It is enriched by an excellent intro-
duction and a chronological table of the principal events of the life of Cicero; while in its ap-
pendix, and in the notes on the text which are added, there is much of the greatest value. The
volume is neatly got up, and is in every way commendable.”— The Scotsman.

“Dr Holden's own edition is all that could be expected from his elegant and practised
scholarship. . . . Dr Holden has evidently made up his mind as to the character os the
commentary most likely to be generally useful ; and he has carried out his views with admirable

thoroughness.''—-A cademy. · ·
“ Dr Holden has given us here an excellent edition. The commentary Is even unusually full

and complete; and after going through it carefully, we find little or nothing to criticize. There
is an excellent introduction, lucidly explaining the circumstances under which the speech was
delivered, a table of events in the life of Cicero and a useful index.'' Spectator, Oct. 29, 1881.
