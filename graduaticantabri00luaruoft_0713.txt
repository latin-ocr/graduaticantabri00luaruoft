HISTORY.

LIFE AND TIMES OF STEIN, OR GERMANY AND

PRUSSIA IN THE NAPOLEONIC AGE, by J. R. SEELEY,
M.A.‚ Regius Professor of Modern History in the University of
Cambridge, with Portraits and Maps. 3 Vols. Demy 8vo. 305.

‘⁴ Is we could conceive anything similar to
a protective system in the intellectual depart-
ment, we might perhaps look forward to a time
when our historians would raise the cry os pro-
tection for native industry. of the unquestion-
ably greatest German men of modern history—-
1 speak of Frederick the Great, Goethe and
Stein—the first two found long since in Carlyle
and Lewes biographers who have undoubtedly
driven their German competitors out of the
field. And now in the year just past Professor
Seeley of Cambridge has presented us with a
biography of Stein which, though it modestly
declines competition with German works and
disowns the presumption of teaching us Ger-
mans our own history, yet casts into the shade
by its brilliant superiority all that we have our-
selves hitherto written about Stein.'’—Deutsclze
Rundschau.

“ In a notice of this kind scant justice can
be done to a work like the one before us: no
short rc‘sumc‘ can give even the most meagre
notion of the contents of these volumes, which
contain no page that is superfluous, and none
that is uninteresting . . . . To understand the

Germany of to-day one must study the Ger-
many of many yesterdays‚ and now that study
has been made easy by this work, to which no
one can hesitate to assign a very high place
among· those recent ,histories which have aimed

in English—nay, European—historical litera-

, from the time of Frederick the Great to the

reader standing ground whence he may regard
contemporary events in Germany in their pro-

which we may congratulate England tghatpon

the history of their own country, by the use of

produced a history of Germany in the Napo-

German. ”—Examiner.

THE GROWTH OF ENGLISH INDUSTRY AND
COMMERCE. By W. CUNNINGHAM, M.A.‚ late Deputy to the
Knightbridge Professor in the University of Cambridge. With

Maps and Charts. . Crown 8vo.

“He is, however, undoubtedly sound in the
main, and his work deserves recognition as the
result of immense industry and research in a
field in which the lffibourers have hitherto been
covpffisstlgzlgnihgham{esethhntaizikely to disap-
point any readers except such as begin by mis-
taking the character of his book. He does not
promise, and does not give, an account of the

dimensions to which English industry and com-
merce have grown. It is with the process of
growth that he is coneerned; and this process
he traces with the philosophical insight which
distinguishes between what is important and
what is trivial. He thus follows with care,
skill, and deliberation a single thread through
219 maze of general English history.”—Guar·

EARLIEST TIMES TO THE ROYAL INJUNCTIONS OF
1535, by JAMES BAss MULLINGER, Μ.Α. Demy ὅνο. (734 pp.)‚ 12s.

“We trust Mr Mullinger will yet continue
his history and bring it down to our own day.'’
—Academw

“He has brought together a mass of in-
structive details respecting the rise and pro-
gress, not only of his own University, but of
all the principal Universities of the Middle
A ges . . . We hope some day that he may con-

tinue his labours, and give us a history of the
Universityv during the troublous times of the
Reformation and the Civil War.¹'—A thenaeum.

“ Mr Mullinger’s work is one of great learn-
ing and research, which can hardly fail to
become a standard book of reference on the
subject . . . We can most strongly recommend
this book to our readers.”—Spectator.
