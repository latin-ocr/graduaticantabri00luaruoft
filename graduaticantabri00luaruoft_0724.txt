“ Messrs Masson and Prothero have, to judge from the first part of their work, performed
with much discretion and care the task of editing Voltaire’s S ibcle de Leuis XIV for the ‘Pitt
Press Series! Besides the usual kind of notes, the editors have in this case, influenced by vol-

taire's ‘summary way of treating much of the history,’ glven a good deal of historical informa-
ti0n‚ in which they have, we think, done well. At the beginning of the book will be found
excellent and succinet accounts of the constitution of the French army and Parliament at the
period 'treated of.’'—Saturday R evz'ew.
